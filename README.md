# Jamala
Notes &amp; Studies on Jamala

Harsh, barren, frozen tundra
"icy pearls" clinging to long grasses
howling winds across plain - give life to stories of Great Wolf hunting, ready to sink icy fangs into unwary travellers

Traditional settlements = colourful, light
circulur; central place given to Hearth, enclosed by meeting hall/tent.
smaller fires/gathering then encircle - spokes of light, reflecting sun imagery

(latitude must mean reduced sunlight hours)

Traditional outline still evident in modern Jakarta
palazzo no longer the centre but ring of outer monuments/temples can still be discerned
Lighthouse = literal fireplace
Modern centre surplanted by national bank - yet logo still contains flame imagery
